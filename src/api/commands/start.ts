I get it. Luckily, there's a way to recall anything you need in the long term with close to 100% certainty. üëå

Just *type* it in the chat, *send* it, and *receive* reminders at 7 intervals:
 ‚Ä¢ 42 minutes
 ‚Ä¢ 24 hours
 ‚Ä¢ 42 hours
 ‚Ä¢ 1 week
 ‚Ä¢ 2 weeks
 ‚Ä¢ 1 month
 ‚Ä¢ 3 months

Use the bot commands to:
*/new* ‚Äî add an item that you want to learn and provide any useful information that will help you recall it later: the definition, explanation, rule, translation, example, or link;
*/actions* ‚Äî stop or continue receiving reminders, delete entries, or show lists of items you‚Äôve added so far;
*/practice* ‚Äî book a lesson to practise what you are learning: English, programming, design, etc.;
*/donate* ‚Äî support our current and future education projects.

Easy memorisation is just a click away.
